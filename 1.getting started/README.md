# Strings

##### String Length
Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.

##### Concatenating Strings
The String class includes a method for concatenating two strings −

> string1.concat(string2); 

This returns a new string that is string1 with string2 added to it at the end. You can also use the concat() method with string literals, as in −

> "My name is ".concat("Zara");

##### charAt
char charAt(int index)
Returns the character at the specified index.

##### Length
int length()
Returns the length of this string.
