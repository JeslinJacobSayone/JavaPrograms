## Collections and Generics

  ArrayList --------------------> List------------------>Collections
                  (implements)            (extends)
                  
we can use collections when we dont know the exact size of the array.
in collection we can store any type of data.If we need only specific type of data then we have to use the generics.

arrays are faster
we cant delete members in between the collection , so we have something called List .

##### Problems with collection Interface

- we cannot add values in between , since it does not have indexes.
- we cannot sort the value
- slower tha ussual array.
